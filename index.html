          New York City teenager Miles Morales struggles to live up to the
          expectations of his father, police officer Jefferson Davis, who sees
          Spider-Man as a menace. Miles adjusts to prep school, and visits his
          uncle Aaron Davis, who takes him to an abandoned subway station to
          paint graffiti. Miles is bitten by a radioactive spider and gains
          spider-like abilities similar to Spider-Man. Returning to the station,
          Miles discovers a collider built by Wilson Fisk, who hopes to access
          parallel universes to bring back his late wife and son, whose deaths
          he blames on Spider-Man. Miles watches as Spider-Man attempts to
          disable the collider while fighting Wilson's henchmen, Green Goblin
          and the Prowler. Spider-Man saves Miles, but Green Goblin shoves
          Spider-Man into the collider, causing an explosion that kills Goblin
          and severely wounds Spider-Man. Spider-Man gives Miles a USB flash
          drive designed to disable the collider, warning that the machine could
          destroy the city if reactivated. After watching in horror as Wilson
          kills Spider-Man, Miles flees with Prowler in pursuit, eventually
          getting away.
